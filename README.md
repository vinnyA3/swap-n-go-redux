# Swap-N-Go-Redux

**status**: Development

This application's client side code is clearly separated from the server.  The reason
for this is to maintain a separation of concerns.  If the server where to update, there is
no reason the client should be effected in any way.

**Note:** This README is lacking currently, but a more detailed explaination will follow.

**Note 2:** Refactor server + client + add setup
